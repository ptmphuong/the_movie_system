ADD DEV DEPENDENCIES ONLY FOR TESTING -> i.e. TOKIO ON IMDB_AUTOCOMPLETE

Right now I have URL's and the DB path hardcoded for my system and because
I am using a virtual machine can't use localhost stuff so maybe find a better
way to setup dev profiles. Possibly in the .env?

NEED TO FIX THE LOGGING FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING... BUT ESPECIALLY TESTING.

LOOK INTO SOME OF GITHUB's FEATURES FOR AUTOMATED TESTING AND STUFF

Some weird stuff with how autocomplete gets json, turns it into a Vec<struct>, sends it to
Warp which turns it back into json to send to Yew which probably turns it back into a Vec<struct>...
So, should probably minimize this whole serialize/deserialize dance somewhere.

Move more stuff into the shared crate when possible.

Need to clean up all the dependencies and sort them into dev/release categories.

Need to add TLS, and also work on the .gitignore to skip over the sensitive stuff.

Add a readme, and maybe make that the landing page.
