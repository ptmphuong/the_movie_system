ADD DEV DEPENDENCIES ONLY FOR TESTING -> i.e. TOKIO ON IMDB_AUTOCOMPLETE


NEED TO FIX THE LOGGING FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING... BUT ESPECIALLY TESTING.

Some weird stuff with how autocomplete gets json, turns it into a Vec<struct>, sends it to
Warp which turns it back into json to send to Yew which probably turns it back into a Vec<struct>...
So, should probably minimize this whole serialize/deserialize dance somewhere.

Move more stuff into the shared crate when possible.

Need to clean up all the dependencies and sort them into dev/release categories.
