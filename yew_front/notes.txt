route search. when search happens:
	yew takes the search string
	sends the string to warp/search endpoints
	warp calls on imdb_autocomplete and sends the results back to yew
	yew display the results 

route register
	yew takes the username, password from the REGISTER button,
	// TODO: verify valid username, paswword with allowed symbols, valid UTF8
	send it the warp/register endpoints
	warp hashes the password with the randomly generated salt,
	then TRIES to insert username | hashed_password | salt | other date info into the db
	if username exists -> failed request returned and error message (in the body)
	else -> ok

route login
	similar to register
	except: not trying to insert, but verify

	Implemented error for Register and Login.
		Register has its own error (password strength, matching repeated password).
		However, Login only uses a general login error now. Should front and back share errors?
	I just add the html_gen part of each page to the end of the file, much less files
