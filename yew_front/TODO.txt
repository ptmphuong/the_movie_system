Some weird error when you search and then fully delete the search...
-> Done, but still some weird stuff with the search results order.
-> Sometimes displays empty results because of the first search returning
-> later than the others...

Sometimes the responses come in out of order maybe? Not sure, but worth checking on. 

Find some way to test Yew stuff...? Not sure if it's possible.
