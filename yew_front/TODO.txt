Find some way to test Yew stuff...? Not sure if it's possible.

Add a catch-all 404 route for bad paths.

Still not super satisfied with the login sessions structure. It would be
a lot cleaner if there was a real shared state between components with user info.

Need to add groups, fairly simple so might as well now.

Add the ability to add movies from the autocomplete and display them based on groups.

Probably clean up main and make another component.

A lot of the html functions could be #[function_components]. Not totally sure of the
benefits but definitely seems worth it for context stuff.

After updating to 19.3 there are some future message things, so maybe I can
get rid of a bunch of the spawn_local() calls.

Add a delay before sending stuff to autocomplete, and like prioritize the most recent.

Fix the navbar, so you don't have to totally duplicate the code.

Need to really stylize things... pretty tedious so maybe can bring in a framework. Not
totally sure how it works but worth looking into.

Move all the request functions in /utils into a new file. 

html_gen functions getting passed contexts doesn't seem right. Function components
and props instead?
