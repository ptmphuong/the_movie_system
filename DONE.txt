Right now I have URL's and the DB path hardcoded for my system and because
I am using a virtual machine can't use localhost stuff so maybe find a better
way to setup dev profiles. Possibly in the .env?
-> Sorta done, not perfect but good enough for now.

Serialize the login and register requests as json before sending.
-> Done, this should have been in one of the crates TODO.txt

Add a readme, and maybe make that the landing page.
-> Sorta done, not the landing page but needs to be updated.

Need to add TLS, and also work on the .gitignore to skip over the sensitive stuff.
-> Looked over it, and for testing need a self-signed certificate and pretty much not
-> worth doing it now.

LOOK INTO SOME OF GITHUB's FEATURES FOR AUTOMATED TESTING AND STUFF
-> Done, could do more but good enough for now.

NEED TO FIX THE LOGGING FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING... BUT ESPECIALLY TESTING.
-> Done, pretty cool solution. Uses ctor to initialize logging for everything except
-> for the wasm stuff. Then, gotta do the same in each test file because compiled separately
-> but at least only have to do it once...

Need to clean up all the dependencies and sort them into dev/release categories.
-> Sorta done, but will need to do it later too probably.

ADD DEV DEPENDENCIES ONLY FOR TESTING -> i.e. TOKIO ON IMDB_AUTOCOMPLETE
-> Done, mostly. Less than I thought. Will need to do this periodically as testing
-> get more complicated and needs more crates.

Some weird stuff with how autocomplete gets json, turns it into a Vec<struct>, sends it to
Warp which turns it back into json to send to Yew which probably turns it back into a Vec<struct>...
So, should probably minimize this whole serialize/deserialize dance somewhere.
-> This is mostly fine, basically need to clean up the json anyways. Worth simplifying
-> if possible but might not be possible.
