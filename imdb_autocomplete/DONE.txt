the search result parsing.
-> Mostly done, not sure on if it's proper or not but can check later.

ADD LEVENSHTEIN DISTANCE FOR FUZZY SEARCHING

-> Is this necessary? Doesn't the IMDB API already do this pretty much?
-> Pretty sure it's unnecessary, but can check later.

-> Done, but still some weird stuff with the search results order.
