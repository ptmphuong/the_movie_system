NEED TO ADD CORS STUFF
Ideally this should block everything except communication between Yew and Warp.
Currently it's set at allow any.

LOGIN/REGISTER

Need to validate basically all of the incoming info.
Currently 'date_created' and 'date_modified' are the same in the DB.
Make passwords be a mix of numbers / letters / symbols?
Make the username an e-mail?

Split up all the stuff in warp into different files.

Find a way to serve all the routes nicely... Not '.or(login_route)'...

Handle all of the 'unwrap()'s

Is it possible to store the Salt and stuff not as Strings in the DB?

Find a way to pass a handle to the DB pool to different routes so it doesn't 
have to reinitialize every time...

Need good warp error codes and 404 rejections. Also need better 200 status code replies.

Does warp have to take every reply by bytes? Where's the nice json body methods?

Not sure why sqlite can't take a relative path in the .env file, and can't manually set the env variable
with std::env::set_var...

Tests don't cleanup DBs when they fail...
